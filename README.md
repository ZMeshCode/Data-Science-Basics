# Data Science Basics and Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository, which showcases the projects I worked on during my first two data science classes. These projects highlight foundational concepts, techniques, and applications in data science and machine learning. Below, you will find an overview of the key projects and their focus areas.

## Repository Structure

### **1. Data Science Basics**
This folder contains notebooks that explore essential data science topics and concepts, such as:
- **Data Analysis**: Exploratory data analysis (EDA), descriptive statistics, and advanced visualizations.
- **Probability and Statistics**: Conditional probability and statistical learning techniques.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Regression analysis and model building.
- **Applications**: 
  - *LeBron James Stat Projection*: A data-driven analysis of LeBron James' basketball performance.
  - *Final Assessment*: A comprehensive notebook combining various techniques learned in the course.

### **2. Machine Learning**
This folder features projects and assignments focusing on machine learning concepts and their implementation:
- **Supervised Learning**: Logistic regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, and Random Forests.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering using EM and other algorithms.
- **Applications**:
  - *NFL Predictive Analysis*: Developing a model to analyze and predict NFL outcomes.
  - *YouTube Dataset Analysis*: Examining trends and metrics from YouTube datasets.
  - *Wine Quality Prediction*: Using classification techniques to predict wine quality.
- **Datasets**: Includes CSV files like dermatology, player stats, MLB stats, and more.

## Highlights
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries and Tools**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
- **Skills Demonstrated**:
  - Data preprocessing and cleaning.
  - Exploratory data analysis and visualization.
  - Building and evaluating machine learning models.
  - Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.
  ## Getting Started

To explore these projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository by running the following command in your terminal: `git clone https://github.com/Zmeshcode/data-science-basics.git`.

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   - For **Data Science Basics**, go to the `Data-Science-Basics` folder and open any `.ipynb` notebook to explore foundational concepts and techniques.
   - For **Machine Learning**, go to the `Machine-Learning` folder to explore supervised and unsupervised learning projects, along with datasets used.

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook to view and execute the notebooks: `jupyter notebook`.

4. If any required Python libraries are missing, install them using the provided `requirements.txt` file by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system before proceeding. Additional dependencies can be installed as specified in the respective notebooks.

## Future Improvements

I plan to continue building on these foundational skills by integrating advanced topics like:

- **Deep Learning**: Exploring neural networks and frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Working on time-series forecasting using advanced models.
- **Large-Scale Data Processing**: Leveraging tools like Apache Spark or Dask to handle big data efficiently.
